Game Hosting Template - HTML5, CSS, JS, Aos Animations

A game hosting template that has a one-page home page. Made in HTML5, CSS, JS, and Aos Animations that were added later to make it look nice and animated, Bootstrap was also used, which also helped a lot in the realization of this game hosting template. It’s easy to use, you can just drag it to your desktop or where you want to take it off and it’s ready to use. I made an effort that it will be quite reviewed and this is my let's say second / third project that he publishes publicly. 

I accept every kind of criticism as well as every kind of help. I would like to learn and be precise.
